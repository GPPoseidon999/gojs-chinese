GoJS is a flexible library that can be used to create a number of different kinds of interactive diagrams, including data visualizations, drawing tools, and graph editors. There are samples for [flowchart](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/flowchart.html), [org chart](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/orgChartEditor.html), [business process BPMN](https://gojs.net/latest/projects/bpmn/BPMN.html), [swimlanes](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/swimlanes.html), [timelines](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/timeline.html), [state charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/statechart.html), [kanban](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/kanban.html), [network](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/network.html), [mindmap](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/mindMap.html), [sankey](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/sankey.html), [family trees](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/familyTree.html) and [genogram charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/genogram.html), [fishbone diagrams](https://gojs.net/latest/extensions/Fishbone.html), [floor plans](https://gojs.net/latest/projects/floorplanner/FloorPlanner.html), [UML](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/umlClass.html), [decision trees](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/decisionTree.html), [pert charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/PERT.html), [Gantt](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/gantt.html), and [hundreds more](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/index.html). GoJS includes a number of built in layouts including tree layout, force directed, radial, and layered digraph layout, and a number of custom layout examples.

GoJS is rendered with an HTML Canvas element (with export to SVG or image formats). GoJS can run in a web browser, or server side in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). GoJS Diagrams are backed by Models, with saving and loading typically via JSON.

<h2>Minimal Sample</h2>

Graphs are constructed by creating one or more templates, with desired properties data-bound, and adding model data.

```html
<script src="go.js"></script>

<script id="code">
  function init() {
    var $ = go.GraphObject.make;  // for conciseness in defining templates

    var myDiagram =
      $(go.Diagram, "myDiagramDiv",  // create a Diagram for the DIV HTML element
        { // enable undo & redo
          "undoManager.isEnabled": true
        });

    // define a simple Node template
    myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Auto",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",
          { strokeWidth: 0, fill: "white" },  // default fill is white
          // Shape.fill is bound to Node.data.color
          new go.Binding("fill", "color")),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 8 },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

    // but use the default Link template, by not setting Diagram.linkTemplate

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    myDiagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
    [
      { key: "Alpha", color: "lightblue" },
      { key: "Beta", color: "orange" },
      { key: "Gamma", color: "lightgreen" },
      { key: "Delta", color: "pink" }
    ],
    [
      { from: "Alpha", to: "Beta" },
      { from: "Alpha", to: "Gamma" },
      { from: "Beta", to: "Beta" },
      { from: "Gamma", to: "Delta" },
      { from: "Delta", to: "Alpha" }
    ]);
  }
</script>
```

The above diagram and model code creates the following graph.
The user can now click on nodes or links to select them, copy-and-paste them, drag them, delete them, scroll, pan, and zoom, with a mouse or with fingers.

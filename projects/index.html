    <h2>GoJS Sample Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the hundreds of samples are in individual pages at <a href="../samples/index.html">Samples Index</a>
      and <a href="../extensions/index.html">Extensions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This directory has subdirectories that hold samples that consist of more than one file or have nested subdirectories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="bpmn/BPMN.html" target="_blank">BPMN sample</a> demonstrates some basics of a BPMN editor.
      The sources are in the <code>bpmn</code> subdirectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a floor plan editor at <a href="floorplannerTS/index.html" target="_blank">TypeScript FloorPlanner sample</a>.
      The sources are in the <code>floorplannerTS</code> subdirectory.
      There is also an <a href="floorplanner/FloorPlanner.html" target="_blank">older JavaScript FloorPlanner sample</a>,
      whose sources are in the <code>floorplanner</code> subdirectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A demonstration of generating, showing, and downloading PDF for a diagram is at <a href="pdf/minimalPDF.html" target="_blank">minimalPDF.html</a>.
      The sample demonstrates both showing the PDF on the page itself as well as downloading it upon pressing a button.
      In a real application it is likely that you would only want to have the user download the PDF file.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example server-side project for running GoJS with Puppeteer is in the <code>puppeteer</code> subdirectory or at
      <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/tree/master/projects/puppeteer">GitHub: puppeteer</a>.
    </p>

      <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/tree/master/projects/maximalSource">GitHub: maximalSource</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a license to the GoJS source code, you can build the subset functionality library

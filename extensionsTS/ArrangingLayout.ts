/**
* A custom Layout that provides one way to have a layout of layouts.
* It partitions nodes and links into separate subgraphs, applies a primary
* layout to each subgraph, and then arranges those results by an
* arranging layout.  Any disconnected nodes are laid out later by a
* side layout, by default in a grid underneath the main body of subgraphs.
*
* If you want to experiment with this extension, try the <a href="../../extensionsTS/Arranging.html">Arranging Layout</a> sample.
*
* This layout uses three separate Layouts.
*
* One is used for laying out nodes and links that are connected together: {@link #primaryLayout}.
* This defaults to null and must be set to an instance of a {@link Layout},
* such as a {@link TreeLayout} or a {@link ForceDirectedLayout} or a custom Layout.
*
* One is used to arrange separate subnetworks of the main graph: {@link #arrangingLayout}.
* This defaults to an instance of {@link GridLayout}.
*
* One is used for laying out the additional nodes along one of the sides of the main graph: {@link #sideLayout}.
* This also defaults to an instance of  {@link GridLayout}.
* A filter predicate, {@link #filter}, splits up the collection of nodes and links into two subsets,
* one for the main layout and one for the side layout.
* By default, when there is no filter, it puts all nodes that have no link connections into the
* subset to be processed by the side layout.
*
* If all pairs of nodes in the main graph can be reached by some path of undirected links,
* there are no separate subnetworks, so the {@link #arrangingLayout} need not be used and
* the {@link #primaryLayout} would apply to all of those nodes and links.
*
* But if there are disconnected subnetworks, the {@link #primaryLayout} is applied to each subnetwork,
* and then all of those results are arranged by the {@link #arrangingLayout}.
*
* In either case if there are any nodes in the side graph, those are arranged by the {@link #sideLayout}
* to be on the side of the arrangement of the main graph of nodes and links.
*
* Note: if you do not want to have singleton nodes be arranged by {@link #sideLayout},
* set {@link #filter} to <code>function(part) { return true; }</code>.
* That will cause all singleton nodes to be arranged by {@link #arrangingLayout} as if they
* were each their own subgraph.
*
* If you both don't want to use {@link #sideLayout} and you don't want to use {@link #arrangingLayout}
* to lay out connected subgraphs, don't use this ArrangingLayout at all --
* just use whatever Layout you would have assigned to {@link #primaryLayout}.

  <p>
  This sample demonstrates reading JSON data describing the relative rankings of NFL teams
  during the 2015 season and generating a diagram from that data.
  The ranking information came from beatgraphs.com.
  </p>
  <p>
  The JSON data is basically just a list of relationships.
  Unlike most model data, there are no elements describing the nodes --
  the node definitions are implicit in the references from the links.
  Hence the <a>Diagram.model</a> has <a>GraphLinksModel.archetypeNodeData</a> set to a JavaScript object.
  </p>
  <p>
  The node template uses the <b>convertKeyImage</b> function to convert the team name
  into a URI referring to an image on our web site.

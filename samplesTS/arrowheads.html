    <p>
      This sample displays all predefined GoJS arrowheads. Select or hover over a Node or its Link to see the names of the arrowheads
      on the Link.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Link shows two arrowheads. The Link template has a Shape whose <a>Shape.toArrow</a> property is bound to an arrowhead
      name. A different Shape in the template has its <a>Shape.fromArrow</a> property bound to a different arrowhead name.
      Each arrowhead has been scaled up to make it more easily visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the definitions of all these arrowheads in the file: <a href="../extensionsTS/Arrowheads.ts" target="_blank">Arrowheads.ts</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For predefined shape geometries, see the <a href="shapes.html">Shapes</a> sample.
